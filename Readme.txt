Short Summary
This paper describes a new method to produce spatially and temporally calibrated NDSI-based satellite snow cover maps utilizing simultaneously captured terrestrial photographs as in situ information. First results confirm a high quality of the produced satellite snow cover maps and emphasize the need for calibration of the NDSI threshold value to ensure a high accuracy and reproduciblity. The software "PRACTISE V.2.1" was developed to automatically process the photographs and satellite images.
